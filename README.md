# 💼 Smart Invoice Parser

Smart Invoice Parser is an AI-powered system designed to automatically process scanned invoices (PDFs or images) and extract structured expense data such as invoice number, date, vendor name, line items, and total amount. Built using modern OCR, NLP, and deep learning techniques — it helps automate and streamline finance workflows.

## ✅ Key Features

- 📥 **Invoice Ingestion**  
  Supports PDF, JPG, and PNG formats. Converts PDFs to images using `pdf2image`.

- 🔍 **OCR & Text Extraction**  
  Leverages Tesseract or Google Vision to extract raw text from invoice images.

- 🧠 **Entity Extraction**  
  Extracts key fields using Regex, NLP (spaCy, Transformers), and optionally LayoutLM/Donut.

- 🧾 **Structured Output**  
  Outputs clean JSON, with options to export as CSV/Excel.

- ✨ **Bonus Features**
  - Multiple invoice layout support
  - UI for invoice upload & preview
  - Confidence scores
  - Export to DB or financial tools
